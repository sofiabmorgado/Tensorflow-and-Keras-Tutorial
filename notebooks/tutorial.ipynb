    "Deep learning enables computational models built of numerous processing layers to learn representations of large datasets with multiple levels of abstraction. These models allowed a significant improvement in many fields. In this tutorial, I will explain how to implement deep neural networks using Tensorflow and Keras, both with the sequential and functional API. Firstly, Tensorflow will be implement to solve s simple XOR problem; then, Sequential Keras will be used to predict classes of objects from the fashion_MNIST dataset and finally, Keras with functional API will be used to implement an autoencoder for the MNIST dataset."

Finally, we must coonsider that larger initial weights will help the network spread more widely from the beggining, but smaller weights may lead to instability. \n",
